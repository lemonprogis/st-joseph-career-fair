## Day in the life of a software engineer

There is no "average day" as a software engineer. I have tried to put together what a single day on the job might entail.

### Morning
Usually will get to the office or login from home between 8 - 9am. Most schedules are flexible due to the nature of our work. We are not based solely on product output. It's a creative process and sometimes it takes a bit to solve the problem at hand. We have a daily stand-up meeting where we all talks about what we did the day before and what we are going to work on today. 
Where I work, we have embraced [Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/). After the meeting, I'll start diving in on a bug that needs to be fixed or work on a feature for the product at hand. 

### Mid-day
With a pretty flexible schedule, lunch usually happens whenever it's time for a brain break. I'll usually step out for a walk and lunch with friends/co-workers. After lunch, come back and dive into some more coding and try to get into a good flow state.

### Mid-afternoon
Coming out of a good flow state means, time for a break! I like play a little guitar or games to unwind a bit before firing back up. I'll usually spend the rest of the day working on some learning and proof of concepts to get our product to the next level technologically. 
Software development moves so rapidly, having learning time is an integral part of your day.  

### Evening
I"ll usually sign off around 5 - 6 to spend time with family and unwind. Usually I may fire up my laptop if a problem needs assistance or if I have something in my head I need to get down.
